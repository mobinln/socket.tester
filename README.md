# Socket Tester

Socket Tester is a simple React app that allows you to test Socket.IO connections.
It is created using Vite for fast and easy development.

## Installation

To install the dependencies for the app, run:
`npm install`

Usage
To start the app, run:
`npm run dev`

This will start a development server at a free port which it tells you on terminal.
You can then open the app in your browser and begin testing Socket.IO connections.

To test a Socket.IO connection, enter the URL of the server you want to connect to in the input field and click the "Connect" button.
The app will attempt to connect to the server and display the connection status in the UI.

You can also send messages to the server by entering a message in the "Text, JSON, ..." input field and clicking the "Send" button.
The app will send the message to the server and display the response, if any, in the UI.
